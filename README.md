This is a small test project that creates wandering butterflies within a window.

This project is nowhere near finished but I am probably finished with it. Code is extremely messy and not documented properly.

Known bugs:
  Butterflies sometimes get stuck on walls.
  Movement is jittery when pathfinding to a mouse location.
  
I may come back and reorganize / rewrite much of the code eventually, but for know I want to move on to simulating other things.
The big take away from this code is the Vector2D class. While not finished, it is relatively clean and organized.
